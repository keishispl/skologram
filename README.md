# Skologram

A Skript Addon to add support with Hologram Plugins.

Currently we support:
- [DecentHolograms](https://modrinth.com/plugin/decentholograms)

Here are a few examples of how to use this plugin. In a Skript file:
- If you want to edit a line: `set line 1 of hologram "cat" to "meow"`
- If you want to create a hologram:
```
create a new hologram:
  name: "jumpscare"
  location: 1 meter in front of player
  lines: "&cRAHH!", "&7Get jumpscared!"
```
- You can also hide the hologram! `hide hologram "ghost" from player`

More Examples can be viewed directly inside the source code, and labeled.


## Requires [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) 2.7.0 or higher to function.

Please suggest syntax ideas in the [Github](https://github.com/keishispl/skologram)! It would help a lot.

For suggestions, you can also suggest them in Github as well!

This plugin was made because I am done with console filling with "This line has been set!", it is crazy.
